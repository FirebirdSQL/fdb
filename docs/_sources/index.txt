.. FDB documentation master file, created by sphinx-quickstart on Wed Jan  7 12:29:48 2009.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

###############################
Welcome to FDB's documentation!
###############################

FDB is a `Python <http://python.org>`__ library package that
implements `Python Database API 2.0`-compliant support for the open source relational
database `Firebird® <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__.
In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API,
FDB also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database engine.

FDB is free -- covered by a permissive BSD-style `license
<license.html>`__ that both commercial and noncommercial users should
find agreeable.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on Python, SQL, or Firebird;
rather, it is a topical presentation of FDB's feature set,
with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns. For detailed
information about Firebird features, see the `Firebird documentation 
<http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=doc>`__, and especially the excellent
`The Firebird Book <http://www.ibphoenix.com/products/books/firebird_book>`__ 
written by Helen Borrie and published by APress.
