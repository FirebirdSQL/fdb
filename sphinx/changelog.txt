Version 1.4.4
=============

Improvements
------------

- (PYFB-47) Firebird client library path added as optinal parameter to :func:`fdb.connect` and :func:`fdb.create_database`.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Additional fix related to PYFB-43
- Additional correction for unregistered problem with circular ref. between PS and Cursor when explicit PS is executed.


Version 1.4.3
=============

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Previous fix for PYFB-43 was incomplete, corrected.


Version 1.4.2
=============

Improvements
------------

- In relation to PYFB-43 I had to make a **backward incompatible change** to event processing API. Starting from this version
  `EventConduit` does not automatically starts collection of events upon creation, but it's now necessary to call 
  :meth:`~fdb.EventConduit.begin` method. To mitigate the inconvenience, EventConduit now supports context manager
  protocol that ensures calls to begin() and close() via `with` statement.
- In relation to PYFB-39 I have decided to drop support for implicitly cached and reused prepared statements. I never
  liked this feature as I think it's a sneaky method how to put some performance to badly written applications that 
  in worst case may lead to significant resource consumption on server side when developers are not only lazy but also stupid.
  It was implemented for the sake of compatibility with KInterbasDB. 

  **This change has no impact on API, but may affect performance of your applications.**

Bugs Fixed
----------

- PYFB-44 - Inserting a datetime.date into a TIMESTAMP column does not work
- PYFB-42 - Python 3.4 and FDB - backup throws an exception
- Unregistered - Fixes in monitor.TransactionInfo


Version 1.4.1
=============

Improvements
------------

- PYFB-40 - fbclient.dll is not found if not in path.
  Aside from registry lookup, client library isn't loaded until first call to :func:`fdb.connect`, :func:`fdb.create_database`
  or :func:`fdb.load_api` (which now supports optional specification of Firebird Client Library to load). 
- Adjustments for Firebird 3.0 (Alpha1)
- Properties :attr:`~fdb.services.Connection.version` and :attr:`~fdb.services.Connection.engine_version` added to :class:`fdb.services.Connection`

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Unregistered - isolation_level parameter for fdb.connection has no effect.
- Unregistered - Information gathered from monitoring tables is not properly dropped upon refresh request.

Version 1.4
===========

New Features
------------

- :mod:`fdb.schema` submodule extended with support for user privileges.

Improvements
------------

- :meth:`fdb.services.User.load_information` method to load information about user from server.
- :mod:`fdb.ibase` content cleanup and additions.
- :mod:`fdb.blr` submodule with BLR definitions.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- PYFB-37 - Unicode Strings incorrect not allowed for insertion into BLOB SubType 1.


Version 1.3
===========

New Features
------------

- :mod:`fdb.monitor` submodule for access to / work with monitoring tables.
- New :attr:`fdb.Connection.monitor` property for access to monitoring tables.

Improvements
------------

- :attr:`~fdb.schema.Schema.closed` property and :meth:`~fdb.schema.Schema.clear` method for Schema.
- Unit tests reworked.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Unregistered: Bug in :meth:`fdb.schema.Schema.close` and :meth:`fdb.schema.Schema.bind`.

Version 1.2
===========

New Features
------------

- :mod:`fdb.schema` submodule for access to / work with database metadata.
- :mod:`fdb.utils` submodule with various helper classes and functions.
- New :attr:`fdb.Connection.schema` property for access to database schema.
- New :class:`~fdb.ConnectionWithSchema` connection class that provides more direct access 
  to database schema than `Connection`.
- New :attr:`fdb.Connection.firebird_version`, :attr:`fdb.Connection.version` and 
  :attr:`fdb.Connection.engine_version` properties.
- New `Connection.ods` read only property that returns ODS version number of connected database.
  There are also new module-level constants `ODS_FB_20`, `ODS_FB_21` and `ODS_FB_25`.
- New :attr:`fdb.Connection.query_transaction` property. This is ReadOnly ReadCommitted transaction 
  that could be active indefinitely without blocking garbage collection. It’s used internally to query 
  metadata, but it’s generally useful.

Improvements
------------

- Optional PEP 249 (Python DB API 2.0) Extensions

  - `Connection.Error`, `Connection.ProgrammingError`, etc.

    All exception classes defined by the DB API standard are exposed on the Connection objects 
    as attributes (in addition to being available at module scope).
  - `Cursor.connection`

    This read-only attribute return a reference to the Connection object on which the cursor was created.

- `Cursor.transaction` read-only attribute returns a reference to the Transaction object on which the cursor 
  was created.
- Optimized wekref management, especially for `PreparedStatement`.
- `create_database` now supports two methods for database screation. You can specify CREATE DATABASE statement
  (as before) or provide set of named database parameters (SQL statement is created automatically from them).
- Functions `connection` and `create_database` now take optional keyword parameter `connection_class` to
  obtain instances of different class instead `Connection`.
- Support for legacy (pre-2.5) shutdown mode with mode `fdb.services.SHUT_LEGACY`.
- :meth:`fdb.Cursor.executemany` returns `self`, so it could be used directly as iterator.
- Documentation inprovements.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Unregistered: `buffers` parameter of `fdb.connection` doesn't support values greater than 255.
- Unregistered: Lowercase character set name passed to `fdb.connect` may result in wrong funcion of automatic
  data conversions and other failures (exceptions raised).

Version 1.1.1
=============

Bugs Fixed
----------

- PYFB-35 - Call to fetch after a sql statement without a result should raise exception
- PYFB-34 - Server resources not released on PreparedStatement destruction

Version 1.1
===========

New Features
------------

- :ref:`Context Manager <transaction-context-manager>` for transactions.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- PYFB-30 - BLOBs are truncated at first zero byte

Version 1.0
===========

Improvements
------------

- Removed dependency on fbclient library to be present at import time (PYFB-24)

Bugs Fixed
----------

- PYFB-25 - Truncate long text from VARCHAR(5000)

Version 0.9.9
=============

New Features
------------

- Firebird ARRAY support.

Other changes
-------------

- Cursor.execute() returns Self, so it could be used as iterator.
- Reading output from Services now uses more efficient method to get data
  from server.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Fix: precision_cache in Connection works as intended.

Version 0.9.1

Just bugfixes to make FDB work on P3K again.

- Documentation; both in-source (in Sphinx autodoc format) and Sphinx (html)
- Services API completely reworked

Other changes
-------------

- Various optimizations and cleanup
- Object reference graph optimalizations
- Many new tests in test suite

Version 0.8.5
=============

------------

- Support for Firebird stream BLOBs (see ReleaseNotes for details)
- Documentation (stub, from KInterbasDB 3.3.0)

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Fix for PYFB-17 and PYFB-18 (see our JIRA tracker for details)
- Fixes for automatic unicode conversions + refactoring

Version 0.8
===========

New Features
------------

Bugs Fixes
----------

- database_info (isc_info_firebird_version) fails opn amd64 linux - `JIRA entry <http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/PYFB-16>`

Version 0.7.2
=============

New Features
------------

- Python 3 Support (thanks to Philippe Makowski)
- Support for Distributed Transactions

And as always, some (unregistered) bugs fixed.

Version 0.7.1
=============

Bug fixes.

Version 0.7
===========

Initial release.

Almost feature-complete (ready for 95% of users), but it could be still buggy (it’s beta!), and the 
code wasn’t optimized for size and speed. In all other ways it’s ready for wide testing.

What’s missing
--------------

- Distributed transactions
- ARRAY support
- EVENTs support
- Stream BLOBs
- TRACE service
- Documentation (but you can use KInterbasDB one as FDB is as close to it as possible).
- Python 3.x support (haven’t had time to test it, but it shouldn’t be hard to make it work there)
