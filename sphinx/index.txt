FDB - The Python driver for Firebird
####################################

FDB is a `Python <http://python.org>`__ library package that
implements `Python Database API 2.0 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_-compliant support for the open source relational database `Firebird <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`_ Â®. In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API, FDB also exposes the entire native (old-style) client API of the database engine and number of additional extensions and enhancements for convenient use of Firebird.

FDB is a `sub-project <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/devel-python-driver/>`__ under the `Firebird Project <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__, and is used internally as key component for `Firebird QA <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/devel-qa/>`__.

FDB is free -- covered by a permissive BSD-style `license <license.html>`__ that both commercial and noncommercial users should find agreeable.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on Python, SQL, or Firebird; rather, it is a topical presentation of FDB's feature set, with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns. For detailed information about Firebird features, see the `Firebird documentation <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/documentation/>`__, and especially the excellent `The Firebird Book <http://www.ibphoenix.com/products/books/firebird_book>`__ written by Helen Borrie and published by IBPhoenix_.
