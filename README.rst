FDB is a `Python`_ library package that implements `Python Database API 2.0`_-compliant support for the open source relational
database `Firebird`_ Â®. In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API, FDB also exposes the entire native
(old-style) client API of the database engine. Notably:

* Automatic data conversion from strings on input.
* Automatic input/output conversions of textual data between UNICODE and database character sets.
* Support for prepared SQL statements.
* Multiple independent transactions per single connection.
* All transaction parameters that Firebird supports, including table access specifications.
* Distributed transactions.
* Firebird BLOB support, including support for stream BLOBs.
* Support for Firebird Events.
* Support for Firebird ARRAY data type.
* Support for all Firebird Services

FDB also contains extensive collection of submodules that simplify various Firebird-related tasks. Notably:

* Database schema
* Firebird monitoring tables
* Parsing Firebird trace & audit logs
* Parsing Firebird server log
* Parsing Firebird gstat utility output
