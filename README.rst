FDB package is a set of Firebird RDBMS bindings for Python. It works on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.x.

FDB is replacement for discontinued KInterbasDB library, and as such it's designed to be as much compatible 
with KInterbasDB as possible, but there are some differences. See FDB documentation for full description 
of these differences.
